### THIS IS USING THE BRUTE FORCE ###
// number is 20 because 20 is the smallest number that is divided by 20
// we increment number by 20 because only even multiples of 20 cand be divided by 20




#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>


int main() {
    int number = 20;
    while(1) {
        if (number % 11 == 0 && number % 12 == 0 && number % 13 == 0 && number % 14 == 0 && number % 15 == 0 && number % 16 == 0 &&
            number % 17 == 0 && number % 18 == 0 && number % 19 == 0 && number % 20 == 0) {
            break;
        }
        number = number + 20; // first was number += 2 because only even numbers can be divided by 2
    }

    printf("%d",number);

    return 0;
}
