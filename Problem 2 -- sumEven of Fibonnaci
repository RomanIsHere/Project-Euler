###
Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:

1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...

By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

    int sumEven = 0;

    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        if (i <= 1) {
            next = i;
        }
        else {
            next = first + second;
            first = second;
            second = next;
        }
        if (next != 0 && next % 2 == 0 && next <= limit) {
            sumEven = sumEven + next;
        }
        printf("%d\n", next);
    }
    printf("This is sum %d", sumEven);
  return 0;
